# Miner-Watch
This is a simple batch file that makes sure your program is running and if not it runs it automatically. 

Commonly used for cryptocurrency miners as they tend to crash a lot.



# Features:

1- Timeout Between Each Check For Running App

2- CPU Priority Settings

3- Lightweight

4- Offline

5- Support for running programs with parameters

6- No need for a config file






# Future Updates:

1- Option to launch with admin permission

2- Option to launch the program in another cmd if the excutable is cmd based.

3- Option to use it inside powershell instead of cmd (Might be deleted due to powershell being updated)


If you have any issues or suggestions please tell me so I can implment them.
